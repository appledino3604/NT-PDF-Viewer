# NT-PDF-Viewer
A simple and efficient application that allows you to open and view PDF files. It is based on Python and uses the tkPDFViewer library to handle the PDF format. You can zoom in and zoom out of the document using the buttons on the toolbar, or use the mouse wheel to adjust the zoom level. You can also navigate through the pages using the scroll bar. However, it cannot edit PDF files, as it is only designed for viewing purposes.
